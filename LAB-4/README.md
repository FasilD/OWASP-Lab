# OWASP A04:2021 - Insecure Design Lab

This lab simulates insecure design vulnerabilities using a realistic Python-based Flask web application called **QuickWallet**. It demonstrates common flaws found in modern web applications where logic is implemented insecurely ‚Äî a critical risk highlighted in [OWASP Top 10: A04 - Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/).
##  Objectives

This lab aims to help developers and security learners:

- Understand and identify real-world insecure design flaws.
- Practice exploiting logic-based vulnerabilities.
- Think like an attacker to improve secure coding practices.

##  Vulnerabilities Simulated

| Vulnerability                         | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
|  Insecure Authentication Logic      | No password hashing, plaintext storage |
|  Auto-account creation on login     | No registration control |
|  Admin panel with no access control | Anyone can access `/admin` |
|  Missing input validation           | No balance check, negative transfers possible |
|  Missing authorization on actions   | No role check for sensitive operations |
|  Missing CSRF protection            | No CSRF tokens or session binding |

Fix recommendations

End-of-lab reflection questions
### Recommended Improvements (Security Hardening)
Use password hashing with bcrypt or werkzeug.security

Implement role-based access control for /admin
Validate transfer inputs (e.g., positive amounts)
Add CSRF protection using Flask-WTF
Separate login and registration
Log user actions for auditing
